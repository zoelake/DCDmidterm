            <p>Our colour scheme reflects the diverse range of plants within our app, and inspired by the four elements from which plants thrive.</p>
            <p>The primary use of color in our app is for background gradients, which create a youthful and vibrant theme.</p>
            <p>Our main text colour is white, and our main logo is comprised of black and white. White is also used for the  status bar during the questionnaire.</p>

            <p>We chose the font “Montserrat” for a clean look. We wanted a font that would be easily readable for the user and a sans-serif font was the easiest choice.</p>
            <p>The font “Bebas Neue” was picked for its boldness while still being readable. We wanted a typeface that would complement and contrast with “Montserrat”.</p>
            <p>Our final choice for typography was “Permanent Marker”, which was used in our infographic. We liked the playful side of it and thought it was a good addition to our other choices, as well as to our colour palette.</p>

            <p>For our iconography, we went with colours that are generally found in nature; for this reason, a large emphasis is placed on shades of green. The rounder shapes are visually inviting, they connect well with our logo and also emulate organic shapes typically found outdoors.</p>
            <p>To create contrast, we used white as a colour for some of the fonts as well as the buttons.</p>
            <p>We chose to use a brighter shade of green for some of the important buttons that must be pressed by the user, so that they stand out among the rest of the content.</p>
            <p>Green icons with rounded edges were used  to exemplify our intention of showcasing organize shapes and colours found in the outdoors.</p>
            <p>Rounded borders on certain images were also chosen to create the appearance of a button- this familiar design creates a connection to clickability in the users’ mind. </p>
            <p>Rules: <br>
                • Icons must be 50px by 50px <br>
                • All Iconography includes 10px bottom margin <br>
                • Buttons will have either a background fill of #94D46C
                OR  a background fill #FFFFFF at 50% with a #FFFFFF 2px solid stroke

            <p>For our graphics, we took a simple approach- playful and direct imagery. Our users will be shown images relevant to the text on-screen that further explains the content in which it is situated with.</p>
            <p>Although many of the images include lots of details, they don’t complicate or take away from the overall design.</p>
            <p>The colour green is heavily emphasized throughout. Other colours are present, but are generally in the smaller details of each image. This ties our graphics to  existing elements, and falls into line with our existing colour scheme.</p>
            <p>Rules:
                <br>
                • Max width of 350px for all images to fit space
